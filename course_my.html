               <h3>7UP</h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">7 Up (stylized as 7up outside the U.S.) is an American brand of lemon-lime-flavored non-caffeinated 
                soft drink.
                The rights to the brand are held by Keurig Dr Pepper in the United States and by 7 Up international in the rest of the world.
                The U.S. version of the 7 Up logo includes a red circle between the "7" and "Up"; this red circle has been animated and
                 used as a mascot for the brand as Cool Spot. Before that, the mascot was a fictional character named Fido Dido created by
                  Joanna Ferrone and Sue Rose. He is used outside the U.S. for limited time retro cups, although the last time and
                   location is not known.

            <h3> PEPSI </h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"> Pepsi is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by PepsiCo.
                 Originally created and developed in 1893 by Caleb Bradham and introduced as Brad's Drink,
                 it was renamed as Pepsi-Cola in 1898,[1] and then shortened to Pepsi in 1961.
                 Pepsi is made with carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, sugar, phosphoric acid,
                  caffeine, citric acid, and natural flavors.[62] A can of Pepsi (12 fl ounces) has 41 grams of carbohydrates
                   (all from sugars), 30 mg of sodium, 0 grams of fat, 0 grams of protein, 38 mg of caffeine, and 150 calories.
                   Pepsi has 10 more calories and two more grams of sugar and carbohydrates than Coca-Cola.
                  Caffeine-Free Pepsi contains the same ingredients but without the caffeine.

                <h3> MOUNTAIN DEW</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Mountain Dew (stylized as Mtn Dew with the homonymic slogan "Do the Dew") is a carbonated 
                    soft drink brand produced and owned by PepsiCo. The original formula was invented in 1940 by Tennessee beverage bottlers 
                    Barney and Ally Hartman. A revised formula was created by Bill Bridgforth[1] in 1958.
                     The rights to this formula were obtained by the Tip Corporation of Marion, Virginia.[2] William H. "Bill"
                      Jones of the Tip Corporation further refined the formula, launching that version of Mountain Dew in 1961.
                       In August 1964, the Mountain Dew brand and production rights were acquired from Tip by the Pepsi-Cola company,
                     and the distribution expanded across the United States and Canada.</p>
